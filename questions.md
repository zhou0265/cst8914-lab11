## What is the keyboard interaction missing
The original JavaScript code only supports mouse clicks via the onclick event. It does not account for users who rely on keyboard navigation or accessibility tools. Here’s what’s missing:

1. **Keyboard Events:** Users should be able to open and close the accordion using the keyboard:
    - Enter Key: Should toggle the accordion when the button is focused.
    - Space Key: Should also toggle the accordion.
2. **Focus Management:**
When a user uses the Arrow Up or Arrow Down keys, focus should move to the previous or next accordion button.
    - Home/End Keys: Focus should move to the first or last accordion button, respectively.

## What is the ARIA missing
The original HTML lacks essential ARIA attributes that help screen readers and assistive technologies interpret the accordion’s behavior and state. Here's what is missing:
- aria-expanded: Each button needs an aria-expanded attribute to indicate whether the corresponding content is expanded (true) or collapsed (false).
- aria-controls: Each button should include this attribute to reference the id of the content it controls.
- aria-hidden: Each content panel (<div class="accordion-content">) should have this attribute to indicate whether the content is visible (false) or hidden (true).
- role="region": Each content panel should have this role to define it as a landmark region for screen readers.
- aria-labelledby attribute should be applied to the content panels to reference the associated button’s id.
